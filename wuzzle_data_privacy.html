        <p><strong>Third country transfer</strong><br>
        For the USA, the European Commission adopted a news adequacy decision on 10 July 2023. Google LLC is certified under the EU-US Privacy Framework. Since Google servers are distributed worldwide and a transfer to third countries (for example to Singapore) cannot be completely ruled out, we have also concluded the <a href="https://business.safety.google/adsprocessorterms/sccs/eu-c2p/" target="_blank">EU standard contractual clauses</a> with the provider to establish an appropriate level of data protection in those countries.</p>
        <p><strong>Retention period<br>
        </strong>The data sent by us and linked to cookies are automatically deleted after 2 months. The maximum lifespan of Google Analytics cookies is 2 years. The deletion of data whose retention period has been reached occurs automatically once a month.</p>
        <p><strong>Legal basis<br>
        </strong>The legal basis for this data processing is your consent pursuant to Art.6 para.1 p.1 lit.a GDPR and ยง 25 para. 1 p.1 TTDSG.</p>
        <p><strong>Withdrawal<br>
